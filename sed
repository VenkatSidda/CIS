The security services have been running as unconfined services, all of which are agents. These agents initiate outbound connections to a designated central management server or cloud-based platform. Once the connection is established, the agents send data, including system status updates and other relevant information, to the central server. This data transmission occurs over the established outbound connection. These agents operate under the Agent Push Model, wherein they typically do not listen for incoming connections from external services or entities."
