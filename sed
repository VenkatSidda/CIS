"The security services are operating as unconfined services, all of which are agents. These agents establish outbound connections to a central management server or cloud-based platform. Once the connection is established, the agents transmit data and other relevant information to the central server. This data transmission occurs over the established outbound connection. Since these agents follow the Agent Push Model, they typically do not listen for incoming connections from external services or entities, resulting in a lower security risk. Although I've raised a support case with AWS regarding SSM and CloudWatch, they have tested it in their environment, where it also runs as an unconfined service. They provided a workaround, but it requires testing. For the time being, while scanning instances, we disable SELinux and qualify the RHEL 9. Eventually, we'll test and address these issues."
